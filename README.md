# BCI Project

Final project of intelligent control systems course, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, IUST (Fall 2020).

State: Finished

## Intro

In this project, the BCI methods described in papers [1-3] will be reproduced and the results will be evaluated.

[1] [Learning Temporal Information for Brain-Computer Interface Using Convolutional Neural Networks (2018)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8310961)

[2] [Subject-Independent Brainâ€“Computer Interfaces Based on Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (2020)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8897723)

[3] [EEG Classification of Forearm Movement Imagery Using a Hierarchical Flow Convolutional Neural Network (2020)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9046799)

## Quick Setup

If you're using Windows 10 64-bit, you can download the project alongside a portable version of python with pre-installed libraries.
Follow [this link](https://mfarzan.ir/bci-project/portable).

## Manual Setup

This project depends on [this fork of moabb](https://github.com/m2-farzan/moabb), so make sure to install it first.

Also install other requirements by running:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
