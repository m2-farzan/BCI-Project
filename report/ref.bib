  abstract = {Despite the increasing use of computers, the basic need for mathematical tables continues. Tables serve a vital role in preliminary surveys of problems before programming for machine operation, and they are indispensable to thousands of engineers and scientists without access to machines. Because of automatic computers, however, and because of recent scientific advances, a greater variety of functions and a higher accuracy of tabulation than have been available until now are required.In 1954, a conference on mathematical tables, sponsored by M.I.T. and the National Science Foundation, met to discuss a modernization and extension of Jahnke and Emde's classical tables of functions. This volume, published 10 years later by the U.S. Department of Commerce, is the result. Designed to include a maximum of information and to meet the needs of scientists in all fields, it is a monumental piece of work, a comprehensive and self-contained summary of the mathematical functions that arise in physical and engineering problems.The book contains 29 sets of tables, some to as high as 20 places: mathematical constants; physical constants and conversion factors (6 tables); exponential integral and related functions (7); error function and Fresnel integrals (12); Bessel functions of integer (12) and fractional (13) order; integrals of Bessel functions (2); Struve and related functions (2); confluent hypergeometric functions (2); Coulomb wave functions (2); hypergeometric functions; Jacobian elliptic and theta functions (2); elliptic integrals \{9); Weierstrass elliptic and related functions; parabolic cylinder functions \{3); Mathieu functions (2); spheroidal wave functions (5); orthogonal polynomials (13); combinatorial analysis (9); numerical interpolation, differentiation and integration (11); probability functions (ll); scales of notation (6); miscellaneous functions (9); Laplace transforms (2); and others.Each of these sections is prefaced by a list of related formulas and graphs: differential equations, series expansions, special functions, and other basic relations. These constitute an unusually valuable reference work in themselves. The prefatory material also includes an explanation of the numerical methods involved in using the tables that follow and a bibliography. Numerical examples illustrate the use of each table and explain the computation of function values which lie outside its range, while the editors' introduction describes higher-order interpolation procedures. Well over100 figures illustrate the text.In all, this is one of the most ambitious and useful books of its type ever published, an essential aid in all scientific and engineering research, problem solving, experimentation and field work. This low-cost edition contains every page of the original government publication.\vphantom{\}\}}},

  abstract = {Advances in cooling technologies have enabled turbine designers to push the turbine entry temperature to temperatures as high as 1700\textdegree C which are well beyond the material limit of the turbine components. Efficient use of the cooling air is a key goal of the turbine designer. Overall cooling effectiveness has increased to values as high as 0.6 in recent advanced cooling designs. In this chapter, the state of the art in film cooling is reviewed, and key advances in this field are discussed. The ideal configuration in film cooling is a slot where a two-dimensional coolant film is initially injected. Key aspects of the slot cooling are presented particularly in light of advanced manufacturing techniques that enable double-walled airfoils with pin fins and slots. The primary focus in the literature and in industrial practice has been on discrete hole cooling due to manufacturing and structural constraints. The role of injection angles, blowing and momentum ratio, density ratio, freestream turbulence, surface curvature, and pressure gradient on the film cooling behavior is explored in this chapter. Various cooling hole designs and their performance are summarized. While the majority of the studies discussed are based on flat plate film cooling studies, the literature on film cooling in full vane passages is also presented to highlight the key effects of the various parameters.},

The two main principles that are necessary for assessing credibility are verification and validation. Verification is the process of determining if a computational simulation accurately represents the conceptual model, but no claim is made of the relationship of the simulation to the real world. Validation is the process of determining if a computational simulation represents the real world. This document defines a number of key terms, discusses fundamental concepts, and specifies general procedures for conducting verification and validation of computational fluid dynamics simulations. The document's goal is to provide a foundation for the major issues and concepts in verification and validation. However, this document does not recommend standards in these areas because a number of important issues are not yet resolved. It is hoped that the guidelines will aid in the research, development, and use of computational fluid dynamics simulations by establishing common terminology and methodology for verification and validation. The terminology and methodology should also be useful in other engineering and science disciplines.},

  abstract = {An investigation into the efficacy of helicopter engine sand filters is conducted. Engine Air Particle Separation devices are broadly split into three categories: Vortex Tube Separators, Integrated Particle Separators, and Inlet Barrier Filters. The first two are inertial separators that scavenge particles by centrifugal force; the latter traps particles on its surface, but all three are designed with the aim or removing all particles from the engine bound air. Each technology is different, which gives rise to varying levels of efficacy. The current work uses low order analytical and numerical models to explore these differences and introduces a metric for quantifying the quality of air-particle separation performance. The vortex tube separators exhibit a high efficiency and low pressure drop, but require auxiliary power to operate and experience considerable drag at high forward speeds. Inertial particle separators do not achieve the high separation efficiencies of the vortex tubes or barrier filters, but have a large mass flow to frontal area ratio, hence low drag. Inlet barrier filters are highly efficient at removing particles and improve in this over time due to the accumulation of particles, but at the expense of a temporally increasing pressure drop. The new metric is a quality factor that can be used to directly compare separation technologies for helicopter. Its application is demonstrated by the inlet barrier filter which, when clean, is the best performing device, but over time deteriorates in quality due to the accumulation of particles.},

Two GTs were modeled similar to GE LM2500+ and Alstom GT13 E2-2012, using TURBOMATCH and chosen to operate at environmental conditions of Usan offshore oilfield and Maiduguri dessert in Nigeria. The inlet pressure recovered (Precov) from the selected filters used in Usan offshore, and Maiduguri ranged between 98.36{$\leq$}Precov{$\leq$}99.51\% and 98.67{$\leq$}Precov{$\leq$}99.56\% respectively. At reduced inlet Precov by 98.36\% (1.66kPa) and, at a temperature above 15\textdegree C (ISA), a reduction of 16.9\%, and 7.3\% of power output and efficiency was obtained using GT13 E2-2012, while a decrease of 14.8\% and 4.7\% exist for power output and efficiency with GE LM2500+. In addition, a reduction in mass flow rate of air and fuel under the same condition was between 4.3{$\leq$}mair{$\leq$}10.6\% and 10.4{$\leq$}mfuel{$\leq$}11.5\% for GT13 E2-2012 and GE LM2500+, correspondingly.

Correlations between electricity consumption/capita and GDP/capita have been analysed and compared with those between total primary energy supply/capita and GDP/capita. A supporting analysis has correlated the proportion of energy used in the form electricity, the 'e/E ratio', with GDP/capita. The general conclusions of this research are that wealthy countries have a stronger correlation between electricity use and wealth creation than do poor countries and that, for the global economy as a whole, there is a stronger correlation between electricity use and wealth creation than there is between total energy use and wealth. The study also shows that, in wealthy countries, the increase in wealth over time correlates with an increase in the e/E ratio. The results imply that the energy ratio (\$/toe) should be replaced by the electricity ratio (\$/kWh) as a development indicator and, more precisely, by the e/E ratio (kWh/toe).

Three key technologies are discussed. These are: vortex tube separators, inertial particle separators and inlet barrier filters. Some of these technologies are retrofitted or designed around specified airframes; other ones are an integral part of the turboshaft inlet design. For the vortex tubes, a complete review of the current intellectual property is reviewed, and a first-order theoretical model is presented to corroborate the performance of this technology. The inertial particle separators are designed as part of the engine inlets. This technology is more amenable to computational fluid dynamic modelling, coupled with particle dynamics and rebound effects. The inlet barrier filters are part of a large category of filtration systems. A first-order filter theory is derived to predict filter performance as a function of key parameters and useful operation time. The integration of the various EAPS with the helicopter system are discussed.},

Approach. By building on recent advances in software for signal analysis implemented in the MNE toolkit, and the unified framework for machine learning offered by the scikit-learn project, we offer a system that can improve BCI algorithm development.

Our analysis confirms that BCI algorithms validated on single datasets are not representative, highlighting the need for more robust validation in the machine learning for BCIs community.},

Accurately decoding kinematic information from brain signals is one of the main challenges encountered in the control of human-like robots. In particular, although the forearm of an upper extremity is frequently used in daily life for high-level tasks, only few studies addressed decoding of the forearm movement. In this study, we focus on the classification of forearm movements according to elaborated rotation angles using electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. To this end, we propose a hierarchical flow convolutional neural network (HF-CNN) model for robust classification. We evaluate the proposed model not only with our experimental dataset but also with a public dataset (BNCI Horizon 2020). The grand-average classification accuracies of three rotation angles yield 0.73 ({$\pm$}0.04) for the motor execution (ME) task and 0.65 ({$\pm$}0.09) for the motor imagery (MI) task across ten subjects in our experimental dataset. Further, in the public dataset, the grand-averaged classification accuracies were 0.52 ({$\pm$}0.03) for ME and 0.51 ({$\pm$}0.04) for MI tasks across fifteen subjects. Our experimental results demonstrate the possibility of decoding complex kinematics information using EEG signals.

Additionally, a commercial gas turbine simulation tool has verified the results of the model. Besides the conventional working fluid air, the model has been investigated for a CO2/H2O working fluid typical for a semi-closed oxygen-combustion gas turbine cycle, since the cooling model will be used for simulation of such cycles and pre-combustion cycles within the ENCAP project.}

The new information on particle trajectories resulting from the work described in this article is that (1) the angle of particle entry to a stage has a significant effect on the location of particle impact and (2) the effects of shear flow relative to a particle that give rise to lift and influence drag contribute to particle dynamics and hence erosion.

  abstract = {Diffusers are extensively used in centrifugal compressors, axial flow compressors, ram jets, combustion chambers, inlet portions of jet engines etc. The energy transfer in these turbo machineries involves the exchange of significant levels of kinetic energy in order to accomplish the intended purpose. As a consequence, very large levels of residual kinetic energy frequently accompany the work input and work extraction processes, sometime as much as 50 \% of the total energy transferred. A small change in pressure recovery can increases the efficiency significantly. Therefore diffusers are absolutely essential for good turbomachinery performance The geometric limitations in aircraft applications where the diffusers need to be specially designed so as to achieve maximum pressure recovery within the shortest possible length led to the development of annular diffusers. In the present study the performance of a series of annular diffusers of divergence angles (9\textordmasculine, 15\textordmasculine, 21\textordmasculine{} and 27\textordmasculine ) are determined.. A 3-d annular diffuser model was done in PRO-E and the analysis was carried out in ANSYS FLUENT. The results are indicated in the form of velocity diagram, pressure diagram, static pressure distributaries and static pressure recovery coefficient along hub and casing wall. The results show some striking features as the divergence angle increases the pressure recovery also increases considerably. Keywords:Flowanalysis,Annulardiffuser,Pressure recovery,Divergence angle,Reynolds number. efficiency can be a substantial improvement in the turbine industry. Following these principles, the current research focused on characterizing the flow in a specific portion of the turbine where aerodynamic losses are impeding technology advancements.

  abstract = {A method for calculating the turbulent isothermal flow in axisymmetric annular dump diffuser geometries is described and appraised. The calculation method is based on the numerical solution of the time-averaged transport equations for momentum, continuity, turbulence kinetic energy and energy dissipation, using a finite difference formulation. A boundary-fitted curvilinear orthogonal grid obtained from a solution of the inverse Laplace equations is used to represent the curved combustor head accurately and reduce numerical diffusion errors due to better alignment of the flow streamlines with the grid lines. Comparison between predicted results and measurements indicates that variations in (1) the overall pressure recovery and (2) the loss coefficient performance of the dump diffuser system, with changes in diffuser design features (for example inner/outer annulus mass flow split or dump gap), can be predicted to within 7 percent of the inlet dynamic head without adopting a more refined turbulence closure. The method is therefore demonstrated to be a useful design tool for dump diffuser geometries.},

Maintaining inlet air, fuel, and lube oil quality will further reduce gas turbine degradation and deterioration.

Recommendations are provided on how the operator can limit this degradation and any deterioration of the gas turbines through proper maintenance practices.

  abstract = {For a brain-computer interface (BCI) system, a calibration procedure is required for each individual user before he/she can use the BCI. This procedure requires approximately 20-30 min to collect enough data to build a reliable decoder. It is, therefore, an interesting topic to build a calibration-free, or subject-independent, BCI. In this article, we construct a large motor imagery (MI)-based electroencephalography (EEG) database and propose a subject-independent framework based on deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The database is composed of 54 subjects performing the left- and right-hand MI on two different days, resulting in 21 600 trials for the MI task. In our framework, we formulated the discriminative feature representation as a combination of the spectral-spatial input embedding the diversity of the EEG signals, as well as a feature representation learned from the CNN through a fusion technique that integrates a variety of discriminative brain signal patterns. To generate spectral-spatial inputs, we first consider the discriminative frequency bands in an information-theoretic observation model that measures the power of the features in two classes. From discriminative frequency bands, spectral-spatial inputs that include the unique characteristics of brain signal patterns are generated and then transformed into a covariance matrix as the input to the CNN. In the process of feature representations, spectral-spatial inputs are individually trained through the CNN and then combined by a concatenation fusion technique. In this article, we demonstrate that the classification accuracy of our subject-independent (or calibration-free) model outperforms that of subject-dependent models using various methods [common spatial pattern (CSP), common spatiospectral pattern (CSSP), filter bank CSP (FBCSP), and Bayesian spatio-spectral filter optimization (BSSFO)].},

Through a framework grounded in governmentality studies, we point out common trends in how this seemingly disparate range of strategies is emerging, evolving, and taking effect. We find that recent sociotechnical strategies reflect and reinforce governance rationalities emerging during the Copenhagen era: regime polycentrism, relative gains sought in negotiations, `co-benefits' sought with other governance regimes, `time-buying' or `bridging' rationalities, and appeals to vulnerable demographics. However, these sociotechnical systems remain conditioned by the resilient market governmentality of the Kyoto Protocol era. Indeed, the carbon economy exercises a systemic structuring condition: While emerging climate strategies ostensibly present new tracks for signalling ambition and action, they functionally permit the delaying of comprehensive decarbonization.},

In this work, the influence of the cylindrical height on the flow field, pressure drop and separation performances within a uniflow hydrocyclone will be studied numerically using Computational Fluid Dynamics ``CFD''. The simulation of the continuous phase is based on the Reynolds Averaged Navier\textendash Stokes ``RANS'' approach, using the finite volume method. The turbulence model ``Reynolds Stress Model: RSM'' was used to numerically solve the adequate equations of a three-dimensional and turbulent flow in order to determine the flow field of the continuous phase. The interface between the liquid and the air core in hydrocyclones was modelled using the free surface model ``Volume Of Fluid: VOF''. Based on the results of fluid flow, the stochastic Lagrangian model ``Discrete Phase Model: DPM'' was adopted in order to simulate particle trajectories and predict the separation efficiency. Comparison investigations showed that the cylindrical height has a significant effect, particularly on pressure drop and separation performances, as increasing the cylindrical length of a uniflow hydrocyclone improves the separation efficiency and pressure drop until a specific value is reached. Uniflow hydrocyclones with cylindrical height L/D=2.15 can be used for classification because their grade efficiency curve is ``S'' shaped, while the other studied cylindrical heights can be used for high separation because their grade efficiency curves showed a high efficiency even for small particles.},

In this study, we analyzed the encoding of single upper limb movements in the time-domain of low-frequency electroencephalography (EEG) signals. Fifteen healthy subjects executed and imagined six different sustained upper limb movements. We classified these six movements and a rest class and obtained significant average classification accuracies of 55\% (movement vs movement) and 87\% (movement vs rest) for executed movements, and 27\% and 73\%, respectively, for imagined movements. Furthermore, we analyzed the classifier patterns in the source space and located the brain areas conveying discriminative movement information. The classifier patterns indicate that mainly premotor areas, primary motor cortex, somatosensory cortex and posterior parietal cortex convey discriminative movement information. The decoding of single upper limb movements is specially interesting in the context of a more natural non-invasive control of e.g., a motor neuroprosthesis or a robotic arm in highly motor disabled persons.},

In turbine operating conditions, some defects may occur which can decrease hot section life. In the present paper, methods used for calculating blade temperature and life are demonstrated and validated. Using these methods, a set of sensitivity analyses on the parameters affecting temperature and life of a high pressure, high temperature turbine first stage blade is carried out. Investigated uncertainties are: (1) blade coating thickness, (2) coolant inlet pressure and temperature (as a result of secondary air system), and (3) gas turbine load variation. Results show that increasing thermal barrier coating thickness by 3 times, leads to rise in the blade life by 9 times. In addition, considering inlet cooling temperature and pressure, deviation in temperature has greater effect on blade life. One of the interesting points that can be realized from the results is that 300hours operation at 70\% load can be equal to one hour operation at base load.},

In this paper, we propose a classification framework for MI data by introducing a new temporal representation of the data and also utilizing a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for classification. The new representation is generated from modifying the filter-bank common spatial patterns method, and the CNN is designed and optimized accordingly for the representation. Our framework outperforms the best classification method in the literature on the BCI competition IV-2a 4-class MI data set by 7\% increase in average subject accuracy.

It discusses their applications to medical data, using graphs and topographic images to show simulation results that assess the efficacy of the methods. Additionally, expect to find:  explanations of the significance of EEG signal analysis and processing (with examples) and a useful theoretical and mathematical background for the analysis and processing of EEG signals; an exploration of normal and abnormal EEGs, neurological symptoms and diagnostic information, and representations of the EEGs; reviews of theoretical approaches in EEG modelling, such as restoration, enhancement, segmentation, and the removal of different internal and external artefacts from the EEG and ERP (event-related potential) signals; coverage of major abnormalities such as seizure, and mental illnesses such as dementia, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer's disease, together with their mathematical interpretations from the EEG and ERP signals and sleep phenomenon; descriptions of nonlinear and adaptive digital signal processing techniques for abnormality detection, source localization and brain-computer interfacing using multi-channel EEG data with emphasis on non-invasive techniques, together with future topics for research in the area of EEG signal processing.  The information within EEG Signal Processing has the potential to enhance the clinically-related information within EEG signals, thereby aiding physicians and ultimately providing more cost effective, efficient diagnostic tools. It will be beneficial to psychiatrists, neurophysiologists, engineers, and students or researchers in neurosciences. Undergraduate and postgraduate biomedical engineering students and postgraduate epileptology students will also find it a helpful reference.},

The steady and unsteady forces were measured by means of a piezobalance, which features a high natural frequency, low interferences and a large dynamic range. In the critical Reynolds-number range, two discontinuous transitions were observed, which can be interpreted as bifurcations at two critical Reynolds numbers. In both cases, these transitions are accompanied by critical fluctuations, symmetry breaking (the occurrence of a steady lift) and hysteresis. In addition, both transitions were coupled with a drop of the CD value and a jump of the Strouhal number. Similar phenomena were observed in the upper transitional region between the super- and the transcritical Reynolds-number ranges. The transcritical range begins at about Re {$\approx$} 5 \texttimes{} 106, where a narrow-band spectrum is formed with Sr(Re = 7.1 \texttimes{} 106) = 0.29.},

As a result, a reduced mean time between maintenance or even unexpected operation faults of the gas turbine during operation could occur. Experience showed a complex interaction of cooling air under different flow conditions and its particle load. To get more familiar with all these influences and the system itself, a test rig has been built. With this test rig, the behavior of particles in the internal cooling air system can be studied at realistic flow conditions compared to a modern, heavy duty gas turbine. It is possible to simulate different particle sizes and dust concentrations in the coolant air. The test rig has been designed to give information about the quantity of separated particles at various critical areas of the internal air system [1]. The operation of the test rig as well as analysis of particles in such a complex flow system bear many problems, addressed in previous papers [1,2,3]. New theoretical studies give new and more accurate results, compared to the measurements. Furthermore the inspection of the test rig showed dust deposits at unexpected positions of the flow path, which will be discussed by numerical analysis.}

  abstract = {Gas turbines are very important nowadays for electric power generation specially that used in the Combined Cycle Power Plants (CCPPs). For this electric power generation, the dynamics of the gas turbine and parameters estimation are very essential. In this article, a simple procedure is used for estimating the parameters of Rowen's model for HDGTs in dynamic studies for analysis purposes. The parameters of Rowen's model for a 265-MW HDGT are derived and several simulated tests using Matlab/Simulink are presented. The way of obtaining the parameters are based on simple physical laws. It explains briefly how to extract the parameters of the model using the operational and performance data. The obtained results via simulations using Matlab/Simulink are highly matched with the involved scientific articles that published in different literature. Furthermore, the obtained results verifies the operational results of the considered HDGT. However, the procedure here is applied on a practical HDGT. The same procedure could be applied for any scale (size) of gas turbines.},

Three twist ratios (Y/H) 4, 6 and 8 for the helical screw-tape hub and three twist ratios (Y/H) 4.5, 5.7 and 8 for the pimpled hub are numerically analyzed and compared. The geometry of the annular diffuser and the inlet condition for both hub configurations are kept constant with inlet Reynolds Number 2.5 x 104. The analysis of the flow features with different twist ratios for the helical screw-tape hub and pimpled hub will help the temperature to redistribute in a helical direction (axial and radial directions); however the helical screw-tape hub gives more effective results. More importantly, the results showed that enhancement of the temperature distribution can be well achieved by decreasing the twist ratio (Y/H).},

They include high specialists as well as students. The goals of all BCI Competitions have always been to challenge with respect to novel paradigms and complex data. We report on the following challenges: (1) asynchronous data, (2) synthetic, (3) multi-class continuous data, (4) session-to-session transfer, (5) directionally modulated MEG, (6) finger movements recorded by ECoG. As after past competitions, our hope is that winning entries may enhance the analysis methods of future BCIs.},

In the tests, an authorized automated measuring system was applied. The experimental data were processed according to ISO 2314:2009 ``Gas turbines\textemdash Acceptance tests'' standard. The available capacity and the GTP efficiency vary from 266 MW and 38.8\% to 302 MW and 39.8\%, respectively, within the ambient air temperature range from +24 to\textendash 12\textdegree\cyrchar\CYRS, while the turbine inlet temperature decreases from 1200 to 1250\textdegree\cyrchar\CYRS. The switch to firing fuel oil results in a reduction in the turbine inlet temperature and the capacity of the GTP. With the full load and a reduction in the ambient temperature from +24 to\textendash 12\textdegree C, the compressor efficiency decreases from 89.6 to 86.4\%. The turbine efficiency is approximately 89\textendash 91\%. Within the investigated range of power output, the emissions of nitrogen oxides do not exceed 35 ppm for the gas-fired plant and 65 ppm for the fuel-oil-fired plant. Within the range of the GTP power output from 50 to 100\% of the rated output, the combustion chamber operates without underburning and with hardly any CO being formed. At low loads close to the no-load operation mode, the CO emissions drastically increase.},

  abstract = {Abstract:For further improvements in efficiency and performance of gas turbines, the secondary air system, i.e. the required cooling mass flow, plays an important role. The pre-swirled secondary air supply is a common method in the aero industry and is a promising option for heavy- duty gas turbine industry to reduce the air temperature for the blade supply and disc cooling. In the experimental investigation reported here, a system with pre-swirl nozzles was run in a test rig. In the rotating system, static and total relative temperatures as well as relative pressures were measured. The disc and the receiver holes in the flow path entering the rotating system were instrumented. In the stationary system, pressures and temperatures were hooked up in the disc to casing cavities. All mass flows entering and leaving the test rig were measured by means of orifices. The effectiveness of the cooling air was measured by changing the following parameters: \textbullet{} disc velocity to swirl ratio \textbullet{} pre-swirler geometry \textbullet{} mass flow. The experimental data show that a significant increase of cooling air performance, i.e. reduction of total air temperature in the relative frame, can be obtained in the system investigated. The measurements of the test rig confirm that the system effectiveness is basically a function of disc velocity to swirl ratio and pre-swirler pressure ratio. The effective pre-swirler velocity depends highly on the pre-swirler design. A one dimensional model to calculate the relative pressures in the distribution holes of the rotor disc is applied to the measured data in consideration of disc friction put in the flow and a subsequent increase of total temperature. Calculated and measured pressures in the relative frame are compared.},

  abstract = {An inlet air filtration system is essential for the successful operation of a gas turbine. The filtration system protects the gas turbine from harmful debris in the ambient air, which can lead to issues such as FOD, erosion, fouling, and corrosion. These issues if not addressed will result in a shorter operational life and reduced performance of the gas turbine. Modern day filtration systems are comprised of multiple filtration stages. Each stage is selected based on the local operating environment and the performance goals for the gas turbine. Selection of these systems can be a challenging task. This paper provides a review of the considerations for selecting an inlet filtration system by covering (1) the characteristics of filters and filter systems, (2) a review of the many types of filters, (3) a detailed look at the different environments where the gas turbine can operate, (4) a process for evaluating the site where the gas turbine will be or is installed, and (5) a method to compare various filter system options with life cycle cost analysis.},

  abstract = {As a key component-connecting compressor and the entrance of combustion chamber, the diffuser is able to increase the pressure and slow down the airflow in order to promote efficient combustion as well as avoid a large amount of pressure loss. In this paper, experimental investigation and numerical studies have been carried out to understand the effects of air bleeding from dump region and dump gap ratio on the total pressure loss and static pressure recovery of the dump diffusers. The ultimate objective is optimizing the dump diffuser design to get the maximum static pressure recovery and minimum total pressure loss. A simplified test model is used to study the effect of the air bleeding from the outer dump region and the dump gap ratio on the total pressure loss and static pressure recovery in the dump diffuser. The impact of the dump gap ratio in the performance of the dump diffusers has also been discussed. Nearly all the pressure raise occurs in the prediffuser, and most of the total pressure loss occurs in the dump region. For the recirculating area in the dump region, the controllable vortex can be introduced. Bleeding air from the outer dump region can improve the velocity distribution near the flame tube. The results show that when 0.4\% of the air is bled from outer dump region, the performance of the dump diffuser is optimal. Hence, the controllable vortex method is effective for improving the performance of the dump diffuser.},

  abstract = {Diffuser is one key component of the gas turbine combustor following the compressor. Its primary function is to slow down the air flow delivered by the compressor in order to promote efficient combustion and avoid large total pressure losses. The impacts of pre-diffuser wall angle and dump gap ratio on the performance of dump diffusers have been discussed in the previous work, but few work has been undertaken on designing diffusers with greater pre-diffuser wall angle. It was observed that apparent flow separation occurred on pre-diffuser wall when pre-diffuser wall angle amplified to certain degree. The pre-diffuser exit flow was distorted, indicating that the uniform exit conditions typically assumed in the diffuser design were violated. Skew distribution of the pre-diffuser outlet flow can result in strong transverse mixing for liquid, the total pressure loss of pre-diffuser increases significantly. In this paper, vortex generators were introduced to delay pre-diffuser separation. PIV system was used to obtain the velocity filed of dump diffuser in the non-reacting condition. Comparisons between experimental results and numerical simulations using different turbulence models show that Reynolds Stress Model (RSM) can better predict flow field of diffuser Calculations result indicated that vortex generators delayed pre-diffuser separation observably and the total pressure drop was reduced to five percent of previous value.},

  abstract = {Electroencephalograms (EEGs) are becoming increasingly important measurements of brain activity and they have great potential for the diagnosis and treatment of mental and brain diseases and abnormalities. With appropriate interpretation methods they are emerging as a key methodology to satisfy the increasing global demand for more affordable and effective clinical and healthcare services. Developing and understanding advanced signal processing techniques for the analysis of EEG signals is crucial in the area of biomedical research. This book focuses on these techniques, providing expansive coverage of algorithms and tools from the field of digital signal processing. It discusses their applications to medical data, using graphs and topographic images to show simulation results that assess the efficacy of the methods. Additionally, expect to find: explanations of the significance of EEG signal analysis and processing (with examples) and a useful theoretical and mathematical background for the analysis and processing of EEG signals; an exploration of normal and abnormal EEGs, neurological symptoms and diagnostic information, and representations of the EEGs; reviews of theoretical approaches in EEG modelling, such as restoration, enhancement, segmentation, and the removal of different internal and external artefacts from the EEG and ERP (event-related potential) signals; coverage of major abnormalities such as seizure, and mental illnesses such as dementia, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer's disease, together with their mathematical interpretations from the EEG and ERP signals and sleep phenomenon; descriptions of nonlinear and adaptive digital signal processing techniques for abnormality detection, source localization and brain-computer interfacing using multi-channel EEG data with emphasis on non-invasive techniques, together with future topics for research in the area of EEG signal processing. The information within EEG Signal Processing has the potential to enhance the clinically-related information within EEG signals, thereby aiding physicians and ultimately providing more cost effective, efficient diagnostic tools. It will be beneficial to psychiatrists, neurophysiologists, engineers, and students or researchers in neurosciences. Undergraduate and postgraduate biomedical engineering students and postgraduate epileptology students will also find it a helpful reference.},
